# IG-LOD
CLARIAH is organized in Work Packages and Interest Groups (IG's). The key goal of each IG is to research, negotiate, propose, and implement technical choices that become a standard requirement in CLARIAH. This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the IG on Linked Open Data (LOD).
