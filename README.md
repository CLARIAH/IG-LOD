# IG-LOD
CLARIAH is organized in Work Packages and Interest Groups (IG's). The key goal of each IG is to research, negotiate, propose, and implement technical choices that become a standard requirement in CLARIAH. This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the IG on Linked Open Data (LOD).

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Linked Open Data are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding infrastructure and applications of LOD
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH LOD tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

- support for the implementation of Linked Open Data services/pipelines in the CLARIAH infrastructure
- support for the maintenance, updates and upgrades of LOD tools
- ...

## Communication

We use the following communication channel:
- gitter?
- slack

## Tasks
- 

## Products

### LOD Browsers
- Anansi
- Brwsr
- Druid

### LOD Storage
- Anansi
- Druid
- DIVE (deprecated). Media Suite aims for a hybrid approach where LOD can provide an auxiliary mechanism for connecting information sources. 

### Linked Data Converters
- CoW (CSV to RDF)
- CMDI2RDF (CMDI to RDF)
- LDWizard (CSV to RDF)

### Miscellaneous
- FoLiA Set Definitions (...)
- Codemeta in LaMachine (...)

### Outreach
- datastories (tool for creating webpages based on sparql queries)

### SPARQL API Generators
- [grlc](grlc.io)

### Topics suggested
- find compatibility between various solutions (e.g. Anansi/Druid, CoW/LD Wizard) within the ClaaS framework;
- improved out-of-the-box availability of existing tools (e.g. DIVE, brwsr) within the CLAAS framework;
- improve compatibility with inter- and national initiatives (e.g. within Pelagios, Odissei and NDE);
- to attract and interact with a larger less technical audience (e.g. via LD Wizard, Data Stories, Notebooks)
- what is the CLAAS way to store & retrieve triples (file storage, triple stores, media fragments)
- how/when/why can/should partners share LD services & data in the CLAAS the infrastructure (using Docker/Kubernetes)
- performance (of querying, updating data, etc)
- the use of grlc (and further development on it)
- link with NDE principles
- link with NDE termennetwerk
- distributed search functionality for vocab and ontology resources

### Vocabularies
- See specifically IG-Curation and the [awesome humanities ontologies](https://github.com/CLARIAH/awesome-humanities-ontologies) list. 
- The need for a good vocabulary to describe metadata as related to linksets datasets
