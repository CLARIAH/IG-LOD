# IG-LOD
CLARIAH is organized in Work Packages and Interest Groups (IG's). The key goal of each IG is to research, negotiate, propose, and implement technical choices that become a standard requirement in CLARIAH. This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the IG on Linked Open Data (LOD). Don't forget to checkout the other IG's at the overall [IG page](https://github.com/clariah/ig/).

## Newsflash!
Next meetup: December 14th, 12.30-14.00 hours, to be confirmed!

## Aims of the Interest Group
In CLARIAH CORE infrastructure and tools were mainly developed on a by work package basis.
The IG-LOD aims to gather, asses and link (or reconstruct) these parts whilst making sure the WP's needs (requirements) are safeguarded.


## Scope of the Interest Group
The IG-LOD is currently organized in four subgroups focusing on:
- Modeling and Vocabulary alignment
- Publication and use, findability
- Sustainability and storage
- Annotation, uncertainty and provenance (reliability)

## Use Cases
- [WP4/5] How can I augment my dataset with information from other datasets?
- [WP4] Link multiple observations of the same person to each other?
- [WP4] How can I analyze Linked Open Data with R / Python Pandas?
- [WP4] Computers can now co-write with authors. Can they also assist me to design my hypotheses?
- [WP5] How can I discover relevant materials beyond searching for names of the person/film that I'm interested in? (tbc)
- [WP5] How can I restrain the resources that provide me with Linked Data (especially from a single graph)? (tbc)

## Communication
- Slack (quick and dirty)
- Github (documentation)
Create an [issue](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-LOD/issues/new/choose) to join!

## Organization
- subgroups by scope components;
- engineers on top, supported by senior staff;
- subgroup meetings and IG-LOD meetings.


## Tasks
-

## Products

### LOD Browsers
- Anansi
- Brwsr
- Druid

### LOD Storage
- Anansi
- Druid
- DIVE (deprecated). Media Suite aims for a hybrid approach where LOD can provide an auxiliary mechanism for connecting information sources.

### Linked Data Converters
- CoW (CSV to RDF)
- Kabara
- CMDI2RDF (CMDI to RDF)
- LDWizard (CSV to RDF)

### Miscellaneous
- FoLiA Set Definitions (...)
- Codemeta in LaMachine (...)

### Outreach
- datastories (tool for creating webpages based on sparql queries)

### SPARQL API Generators
- [grlc](grlc.io)

### Topics suggested
- Service for permanant identifiers for subjects (e.g. Shall we bless w3id next to handle?)
- find compatibility between various solutions (e.g. Anansi/Druid, CoW/LD Wizard) within the ClaaS framework;
- improved out-of-the-box availability of existing tools (e.g. DIVE, brwsr) within the CLAAS framework;
- improve compatibility with inter- and national initiatives (e.g. within Pelagios, Odissei and NDE);
- to attract and interact with a larger less technical audience (e.g. via LD Wizard, Data Stories, Notebooks)
- what is the CLAAS way to store & retrieve triples (file storage, triple stores, media fragments)
- how/when/why can/should partners share LD services & data in the CLAAS the infrastructure (using Docker/Kubernetes)
- performance (of querying, updating data, etc)
- the use of grlc (and further development on it)
- link with NDE principles
- link with NDE termennetwerk
- distributed search functionality for vocab and ontology resources
- recommendation on metadata describing (documenting) a dataset within Clariah; ex: title (name), description, ownership, license, provenance, temporal and/or spatial coverage, keywords, etc. Which properties should be made mandatory? Which vocabulary (schema, dc, void, etc.)?

### Vocabularies
- See specifically IG-Curation and the [awesome humanities ontologies](https://github.com/CLARIAH/awesome-humanities-ontologies) list.
- The need for a good vocabulary to describe metadata as related to linksets datasets (VOID?)
